# MultiEconomy

# Example of creating a new economy:

# If I wanted to create a new economy called coins, I would do the following...
# I would add the word coins to the economy-types list below
# Then you would create something like this....

# coins:
#   name: Coins
#   symbol: YourSymbolHere
#   start_amount: 100
#   item: BOOK
#   slot: 3

# If you don't follow the example above you have a good chance of breaking the plugin.

economy-types:
- "gems"
- "tokens"
- "crystals"
